This script takes an M3U file as input and generates strm files for each stream/entry in the M3U file, sorted into subdirectories matching the groups in which the entry in the M3U belongs to.

This script takes a single argument which can be either a URL or a file
The target must be a valid M3U file preferably in M3U Plus format (most IPTV providers will let you pass an paramter to the download URL like type=m3u_plus)
